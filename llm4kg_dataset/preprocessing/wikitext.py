Box Office Mojo has been plagued by errors for re-released films since the site was overhauled in 2019, whereby it often double-counts older grosses, as is the case for ''Titanic''. As of 2019, Box Office Mojo correctly recorded that ''Titanic'' had grossed $1.843 billion on its original release, $344 million from its 3D reissue in 2012, and a further $692,000 from a limited release in 2017 for a lifetime total of $2.187 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Titanic (1997) |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]  |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0120338/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027003338/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0120338/ |access-date=October 27, 2019|archive-date=October 27, 2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a limited re-release in 2020, Box Office Mojo incorrectly added $7 million to the original release total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Titanic (1997) |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]  |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0120338/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030074558/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0120338/ |access-date=October 30, 2020|archive-date=October 30, 2020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2021, Box Office Mojo had corrected the original release total, but added the $7 million figure to both the 2012 and 2017 reissue totals, incorrectly increasing the lifetime total by $14 million to $2.202 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Titanic (1997) |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]  |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0120338/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211026222823/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0120338/ |access-date=October 26, 2021|archive-date=October 26, 2021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of 2023, Box Office Mojo corrected the total for the 2017 reissue, bringing the lifetime gross down $2.195 billion, but retained the error in the 2012 reissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Titanic (1997) |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]  |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0120338/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230205001927/https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0120338/ |access-date=February 28, 2023|archive-date=February 5, 2023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Numbers also has an incorrect figure recorded for the lifetime gross. The Numbers does not log individual releases, but had the lifetime total recorded as $2.186 billion in September 2014 (roughly equating to $1.843 billion for the original release and $343.6 million for the 3D reissue).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Titanic |website=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]  |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Titanic#http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/#tab=summar&amp;tab=summary |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902192258/http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Titanic#http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/#tab=summar&amp;tab=summary |access-date=September 2, 2014|archive-date=September 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A couple of weeks later, The Numbers increased the lifetime gross to $2.208 billion, without explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Titanic |website=[[The Numbers (website)|The Numbers]]  |url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Titanic#http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/#tab=summary&amp;tab=summary |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913203854/http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Titanic#http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/#tab=summary&amp;tab=summary |access-date=September 13, 2014|archive-date=September 13, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 2023 re-release, the totals at both trackers were inflated above the true figure.
